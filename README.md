# My Developer Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio site built to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a developer and engineering technician. I wanted to create something that not only displays my work but also reflects my personality and approach to problem-solving.

## What I Built

I created a modern, responsive portfolio with several key sections:

- **Home/Hero**: Quick intro to who I am
- **About**: My background, skills, and a bit about my journey
- **Projects**: Showcase of my technical work
- **Experience**: My professional background and education
- **Contact**: Ways to get in touch with me

## Tech Stack

I chose these technologies because they offer a good balance of performance, developer experience, and flexibility:

- **React**: For building the UI components
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better code organization
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling (saved me tons of time)
- **Vite**: For fast builds and development experience

## Getting Started

If you want to run this locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Project Structure

I organized the code like this:

```
src/
├── assets/      # Images and static files
├── components/  # React components for each section
├── data/        # Content data (experience, projects, etc.)
├── types/       # TypeScript interfaces
└── App.tsx      # Main application component
```

Each folder has its own README with more details about what's inside.

## Design Choices

I went with a dark theme with gold/silver accents because I wanted something that looks professional but still stands out. The animated star background adds some visual interest without being distracting.

I built this with responsiveness in mind, so it works well on mobile devices too.

## Future Improvements

Some things I might add later:
- Blog section
- More detailed project case studies
- Dark/light theme toggle
- More interactive elements

## Deployment

The site is built to be easily deployed to any static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
